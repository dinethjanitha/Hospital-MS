# Hospital Management System – V1 #

This system is basic hospital management system. It is web based system. I has use mainly PHP for developed that system. In here I has add basic hospital requirements it is

* System admin panel
* add new wards 
* manage wards(search,view,edit,delete)
* add medicines
*  manage medicines(search,view,edit,delete)
*  add doctors
*  manage doctors(search,view,edit,delete)
*   assign doctors to wards

I has make system admin panel for give access to users for the system. example is that overall system has admins they are called systemadmin . they can make new system managers for the HMS. System managers only can handle hospital management functions. they can’t make new admins for the HMS.  System Admins can manage all System Managers
That HMS system is help to understood how many wards are available , how many doctors are available, how many medicines are available and manage and assign doctors for the wards.
This project I has make for improve my own skill if there have any bugs you can email me for make pull request.  I hope to add more features for that HMS system.
In blow I has provide simple use case diagram for understood that Hospital management system.
